# MuJoCo-Brax Tasks for PAL Robotics

### Package Management with UV

This project uses `UV` as the package manager instead of `pip`.

- **Installing Dependencies:**
```bash
uv pip install [dependency]
```
- **Running the file**
```bash
uv run 1_create_ant.py
```

## Task 1: Simulating the Ant Robot in MuJoCo
Using MuJoCo, a simulation of the Ant robot is created, applying random controls to its joints and rendering it in `mujoco.viewer`.

### **Key Methods:**
- **Loading the Model:**
  ```python
  model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string(xml_string)
  data = mujoco.MjData(model)
  ```
- **Launching the Viewer:**
  ```python
  with mujoco.viewer.launch_passive(model, data) as viewer:
  ```
- **Applying Random Controls:**
  ```python
  data.ctrl[:] = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=model.nu)
  ```
- **Stepping the Simulation:**
  ```python
  mujoco.mj_step(model, data)
  ```

### **Simulation Output:**

## Task 2: Replicating Multiple Ant Robots in MuJoCo
A function is implemented to replicate the Ant robot multiple times in the same MuJoCo model, positioning them in a grid. Each robot is controlled independently with random actions.

### **Key Methods:**
- **Replicating the Model:**
```python
def replicate(num_envs, env_separation, envs_per_row, xml_string):
```
- **Creating a Ground Plane:**
```python
new_spec.worldbody.add_geom(
type=mujoco.mjtGeom.mjGEOM_PLANE, size=[20, 20, .1], material='grid')
```
- **Placing Models in a Grid:**
```python
row, col = divmod(i, envs_per_row)
x_pos, y_pos = col * env_separation, row * env_separation
frame = new_spec.worldbody.add_frame(pos=[x_pos, y_pos, 0])
```
- **Controlling All Models with Random Action:**
```python
data.ctrl[:] = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=model.nu)
```

- Earlier, The documentation recommended modifying XML files manually to assign unique IDs for each part. With `MjSpec`, this is handled automatically, making replication much easier.
- Another issue was that the original model remained, and each replication added one more instance instead of replacing it. To fix this, I had to create an entirely new environment and add the replicated models there.
- This also solves another taskâ€” Generalizing the replication function to work with any XML robot model, such as the orange humanoid from MuJoCo. The function correctly replicates different environments without modification.

### **Simulation Output:**

## Task 3: Training a PPO Policy for the Ant Robot in Brax
The Ant robot is trained using Brax's Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation. The training runs in a parallelized environment using JAX for hardware acceleration.

### **Key Methods:**
- **Initializing the Environment:**
```python
env = envs.get_environment(env_name="ant", backend="generalized")
```
- **Training the Policy:**
```python
make_inference_fn, params, _ = train_fn(environment=env)
```
- **Saving the Trained Model**
```python
model.save_params('ant_ppo_policy', params)
```

## Task 4: Saving and Testing the PPO Policy in MuJoCo  
The trained PPO policy from Brax is loaded and tested in a MuJoCo simulation. The actions predicted by the trained model are applied to the Ant robot in MuJoCo.

### **Key Methods:**  
- **Loading the Trained PPO Policy:**  
```python
params = model.load_params('ant_ppo_policy')
inference_fn = make_inference_fn(params)
jit_inference_fn = jax.jit(inference_fn)
```
- **Applying the Trained Policy Actions to MuJoCo**
```python
rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
state = jax.jit(env.reset)(rng)

for _ in range(n_steps):
    act_rng, rng = jax.random.split(rng)
    ctrl, _ = jit_inference_fn(state.obs, act_rng)
    data_mj.ctrl[:] = np.array(ctrl) 
    mujoco.mj_step(model_mj, data_mj)
    viewer.sync()
    time.sleep(0.01)
```
### **Simulation Output:**

- Training for 50,000,000 time steps on an RTX 3050 Ti Mobile GPU took around 20 minutes.
- Reducing the number of steps made training faster but likely impacted convergence.
- Running on a faster GPU would improve training quality and stability.
